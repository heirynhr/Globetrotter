### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Add your response here

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Had I had more time I would have spent more time on the css design of the website. I definitely would have added a map highlighting all the different habitats within Venezuela to emphasis my points. Not to mention, I would attempted to embed the resources I linked like the video or the songs into my gallery.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
